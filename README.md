# Restaurant Table Booking System

A simple restaurant table booking system implemented using JavaScript, leveraging data structures such as Arrays, Queues, and Hashmaps, along with Classes & Objects.

## Data Structures Used:
- **Queues** for managing the booking process.
- **Hashmaps** for storing table data and availability.

## Features:
- Automatically books a table based on the number of guests.
- If a table is unavailable, guests are upgraded to a larger table based on availability.
  - Example: If all 2-seater tables are booked, guests are shifted to a 4-seater or 6-seater.
